input_settings:

    # Base input directory

    # "datasets" denotes a list of experiments to run, each with the folling specified (a * indicates required options):
    #   *net_version: name to give this network. Will be used to organize output files 
    #
    #   net_files: list of one or more network files, 
    #       or a .mat file containing multiple networks.
    #       multi_net must be set to True if multiple networks are to be combined.
    #       the path should be from <input_dir>/<net_version>
    #
    #   string_net_files: a list of full STRING files, meaning all 16, tab-delimited columns are present
    #       the path should be from <input_dir>/<net_version>
    #
    #   *exp_name: the name to give the experiment to run
    #
    #   *pos_neg_file: a 3 column, tab-delimited file with two lines per term.
    #       Col1: term, Col2: 1 or -1 denoting positive or negative, and a comma-separated list of proteins
    #
    #   only_functions_file: a file containing the GO term IDs to run.
    #
    #   taxon_file: a tab-delimited file indicating the NCBI taxononmy ID (2nd col) for each gene/UniProt ID (1st col).
    #       Necessary to perform Leave-One-Species-Out (LOSO) evaluation.
    #
    #   only_taxon_file: a file containing the taxon IDs to evaluate. Also used to get the names of the species
    #
    #   pos_neg_file_eval: same as the pos_neg_file, only these annotations are used to evaluate.
    #       Some use cases: temporal holdout, or recovering annotations of another evidence code
    #
